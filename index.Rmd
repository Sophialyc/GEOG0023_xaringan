#Sensors in Remote Sensing
Sensors are instruments that collect data about earth processes or atmospheric components.

- **Active sensors**: Provide own source of energy to illuminate object and its sensor measures reflected energy
- **Passive sensors**: Detect source of energy that is naturally available from the Sun

Synthetic Aperture Radar(SAR)is an example of Active sensor

#What is Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR)?
- World War II, the Radar was regarded as an invaluable defensive tool for identifying ships and planes in darkness and through cloud cover and fog.

- Limited by technology at that time, a high-flying plane would have had to carry an antenna almost as big as a football field to provide sufficient resolution

.pull-left[
- An engineer named .my-style[**Carl Wiley**] solved the problem in 1951 by developing:

.orange[**Simultaneous Buildup Doppler**] = The first SAR that...

#Applications of SAR in research 
.orange[*Forest mapping and monitoring with interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR)*] 

.my-style[H. Balzter], 2001
- Interferometric SAR (InSAR) was applied to monitor variations in biomass in forest ecosystems

- through the interferometric information about the imaging geometry --> improve biomass retrieval from radar backscatter 

- The fringe frequencies of the interferogram --> correct radar backscatter intensity for terrain effects

.orange[*Marine oil spill detection using Synthetic Aperture Radar over Indian Ocean*]

.my-style[Naz, S. et al], 2021
-  Oil spill detection and monitoring over Indian Ocean using Sentinel-1  --> accurate at wind speed of 3 to 9 m/s for all events

- SAR overcomes constraints of other RS satellites such as limited to cloud cover, sun glint

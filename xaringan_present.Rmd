#Sensors in Remote Sensing
Sensors are instruments that collect data about earth processes or atmospheric components.

- **Active sensors**: Provide own source of energy to illuminate object and its sensor measures reflected energy
- **Passive sensors**: Detect source of energy that is naturally available from the Sun

Synthetic Aperture Radar(SAR)is an example of Active sensor

#What is Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR)?
- World War II, the Radar was regarded as an invaluable defensive tool for identifying ships and planes in darkness and through cloud cover and fog.

- Limited by technology at that time, a high-flying plane would have had to carry an antenna almost as big as a football field to provide sufficient resolution

- Hence, an engineer named .my-style[Carl Wiley] solved the problem with creating **Simultaneous Buildup Doppler** --> The first SAR that...

create detailed radar image using an antenna that is 1/100th the size of the football field-long antenna traditional radar would require to precisely analyze the frequency of the return signal

#Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR)
- An active microwave sensor onboard either space-borne or air-borne, illuminates the target with a focused, directional beam of energy, producing unique scattering effect (backscattering) depending on the orientation of the sensed objects @

Backscatter: the portion of outgoing radar signal that the target redirects towards the radar
Below shows a graph with different types of backscattering

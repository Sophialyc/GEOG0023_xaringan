#Sensors in Remote Sensing
Sensors are instruments that collect data about earth processes or atmospheric components.

- **Active sensors**: Provide own source of energy to illuminate object and its sensor measures reflected energy
- **Passive sensors**: Detect source of energy that is naturally available from the Sun

Synthetic Aperture Radar(SAR)is an example of Active sensor

#What is Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR)?
- World War II, the Radar was regarded as an invaluable defensive tool for identifying ships and planes in darkness and through cloud cover and fog.

- Limited by technology at that time, a high-flying plane would have had to carry an antenna almost as big as a football field to provide sufficient resolution

.pull-left[
- An engineer named .my-style[**Carl Wiley**] solved the problem in 1951 by developing:

.orange[**Simultaneous Buildup Doppler**] = The first SAR that...

.orange[*create detailed radar image using an antenna that is 1/100th the size of the football field-long antenna traditional radar would require to precisely analyze the frequency of the return signal*]

#Principles of SAR imagery 1
- SAR is an active **microwave** sensor on board, either space-borne or air-borne, that illuminates the target with a focused, directional beam of energy, producing unique scattering effect (.red[backscattering]) depending on the orientation of the sensed objects

Backscatter: the portion of outgoing radar signal that the target redirects towards the radar
Below shows a graph with different types of backscattering

  * Granular pattern noise: created from interaction with high-frequency radar waves and targeted area]
